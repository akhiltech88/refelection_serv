                <p>The pain and grief associated with the loss of a loved one is an inevitable fact of life .</p>
                <p>
                    As difficult as the loss itself is to cope with , a family then have to decide what to inscribe on the limited space available on the head stone. A normal inscriptionrecords Date of Birth and Death , and a few lines besides, but this, in no way, truly
                    reflects the pleasures and memories shared during a life time
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having experienced the same emotions and pressures following the loss of a loved one, Quietâ€‘Reflections was created to allow people to express and display all thehappy memories, experiences and moments shared . Unlimited by space, they can
                    add in their own works, exactly what they want to say, supported by photographs
                    and music. They can create a Family Diary of the shared memories and good times
                    that were a part of their passage through life .
